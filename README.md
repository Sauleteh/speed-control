# Speed Control Plugin
A plugin made to transform the default experience of Rocket League into a racing experience, adjusting the max speed you can get using the boost, the acceleration of the boost and the gravity that affects the car to play custom maps that were made to race. Recommended the plugin <a href="https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/34">First Person</a> to get a better experience.

From there, you can: enable/disable the plugin, change the max speed, the acceleration and the gravity. Resetting the values will change them to the default game settings.<br/>
If you double click a slider, you can write the values you want. There is no limit on the values but be warned that extremely high values can sent you to another world.
